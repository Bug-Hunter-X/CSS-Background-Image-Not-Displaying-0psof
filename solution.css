The corrected CSS code ensures that the path to the background image is accurate.  Verify the image file exists in the specified location relative to the CSS file or use an absolute path if necessary.

```css
.my-element {
  background-image: url(../images/background.jpg);
}
```

If the issue persists, inspect your browser's developer console for any network errors that might indicate problems loading the image.
